# hello-world
This is me, continuing tradition on GitHub with famous phrase 'Hello World'. Which,to me, has a deeper meaning. I am learning to code for about two months (45 days) and am glad to be given the opportunity to join such community.

I'm planning of becoming Web-Developer, hoperfully Full-Stack. I've done HTML and CSS. I'm very pleased on my progress.
At the moment, I'm conquering JavaScript which , I must say, is very intresting.
